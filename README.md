Nirvikalpa Agent is a self-hosted, Docker-native autonomous AI platform for software generation, evaluation loops, and MLOps experimentation.

It provides a complete local alternative to cloud-hosted LLM services by combining:

multi-agent planning and execution

sandboxed code runners

local open-source models

retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

observability and metrics

evaluation harnesses

reproducible Docker deployments

Built for engineers who want full control over models, data, and execution.
